/**
 * Range implementation for the dFor.
 *
 * A range is a d-dimensional hypercube together with a translation. It
 * identifies an index set. Consequently, it is a generalisation of TBB's
 * blocked_range2d.
 *
 * The range basically implements an kd-tree-like approach: Whenever a split
 * is invoked (due to the constructor), it analyses along which coordinate
 * axis that cube is the longest. Then, it cuts the cube along this axis into
 * two parts of (besides rounding) the same size. A cube basically can be
 * split as long as its volume is greater than zero, i.e. as long as it
 * contains more than one vertex along one coordinate axis.
 * However, the standard behaviour of the range also takes into account the
 * minimum grain size. Therefore a cube is not divided down to only one
 * vertex, but the division process may be stopped with a number of vertices
 * equal or larger than the given grain size. This is done due to
 * performance issues in multicore parallelization. An example of the
 * division process is illustrated below on the left-hand side.
